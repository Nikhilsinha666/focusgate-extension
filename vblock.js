// ONE VIDEO, ONE COVER — the arbiter three extensions share.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The problem this exists to solve
//
// FocusGate, "Keyword Nutrition for YouTube" and "Block Sites Until I Complete ANKI" are three
// separate extensions that do the same thing to the same element. Each one, with its AI check on,
// appends a cover INSIDE #movie_player, pauses the <video>, and re-evaluates the page on a timer and
// on a MutationObserver. Installed together on one watch page that is four independent loops writing
// to one subtree, and the result is not three covers — it is a strobe:
//
//   1. A's cover is appended. That is a childList mutation inside the player.
//   2. B's observer (subtree of <body> / of <html>) sees it and runs a full pass.
//   3. B's pass tears its own cover down and rebuilds it, which is another mutation.
//   4. C's observer sees THAT and runs a pass. Which A's… and so on, at the floor of
//      whatever debounce each one uses.
//
// On top of the loop, each cover animates a fade-in when it is inserted, so every rebuild is a
// visible flash even in the frames where nothing was ever actually missing. And underneath all of it
// the three fight over playback: one of them calls play() when its own verdict comes back clean while
// the other two still have the video held, so `play` → `pause` → `playing`/`waiting` events feed yet
// more evaluation passes.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The rule
//
// At most ONE extension draws a cover over a given player at a time, and only that one holds the
// video. The other two stand down: no cover, no pause, no resume. They keep their own verdicts and
// their own counters — nothing about the decision changes — they simply do not draw.
//
// Ownership is a lease, written to one attribute on <html> because that is the only thing three
// isolated worlds share. It is taken by:
//
//   SEVERITY first.  A settled refusal ("block") outranks a check in progress ("check"), so a video
//                    one extension has actually refused is never left showing another's "analysing…"
//                    panel. This is the half that keeps the outcome correct.
//   RANK second.     A fixed, arbitrary order breaks ties, so two extensions in the same state agree
//                    on which of them draws without needing to talk.
//
// The lease EXPIRES. The holder restamps it while it is still drawing; if that stops — the extension
// was switched off, the tab navigated, the worker was evicted mid-check — it goes stale in a couple
// of seconds and the next claimant takes over. That is what stops one crashed extension from leaving
// the player permanently un-coverable by the other two.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The second half: marked UI
//
// Ownership alone does not stop the observer loop, because every extension has OTHER UI on the page
// that churns — a floating clock repainting every 250ms, a progress panel re-rendering as a check
// advances, a scan animation. So every element any of the three injects carries `data-vblock-ui`,
// and every observer ignores mutations that happened inside one. An extension's own UI is not page
// content and was never worth re-evaluating the page over — not its own, and certainly not a
// neighbour's.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Notes on the implementation
//
//   * Three IDENTICAL copies of this file, one per extension, differing in the two lines marked
//     below. Not a shared module: they cannot share one. Content scripts run in a world per
//     extension, so `window.__VBlock` here is invisible to the other two — the DOM attribute is the
//     entire channel, which is also what makes this work when only one of the three is installed.
//   * Stateless. Everything it knows is read back out of the attribute, so a re-injection after an
//     extension reload cannot desynchronise it, and there is nothing to migrate.
//   * Never throws. Every DOM touch is guarded; a failure degrades to "I do not own the cover",
//     which is the safe answer — the caller draws nothing rather than drawing over somebody else.
